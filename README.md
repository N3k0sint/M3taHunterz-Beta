## 💀 Overview
M3taHunterz Beta is a GUI-based tool designed for **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** analysis and **Privacy Protection (Anti-Forensics)**. Unlike standard command-line tools, it provides a visual interface to extract, map, clean, and spoof metadata from digital imagery.

It features an **Offline-First** architecture, allowing investigators to map GPS coordinates without an active internet connection (after caching).

## ⚡ Features (Beta Version)

### 🔍 Analysis (Blue Team)
* **Deep Metadata Extraction:** View hidden EXIF tags (Software, Hardware, Dates).
* **Live Map & Preview:** Split-screen view showing the target image alongside its GPS location on an interactive map.
* **Smart Dashboard:** Double-click any metadata line to **Quick Edit** (Safe Mode automatically backs up original files).
* **Clipboard Support:** One-click "Copy All" button for easy reporting.

### 🛡️ Counter-Forensics (Red Team)
* **Evidence Scrubbing:** One-click removal of all metadata to sanitize files for safe sharing.
* **Advanced Spoofing:** Inject fake GPS coordinates and modify critical hardware IDs.
* **Tag Injection:** Plant false flags including:
    * `BodySerialNumber` (Fake specific device IDs)
    * `CameraOwnerName` (Impersonate ownership)
    * `LensMake` / `LensModel`

### 🎨 Customization
* **Theming:** Hacker-style dark UI with static logo positioning.
* **Privacy Mode:** Integrated history wiper to delete local map caches (`.db` files).
